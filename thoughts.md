- Becoming a good developer goes far beyond pure technical knowledge. Effective strategies for note-taking, time-management, and research are crucial for remaining organized and effective as the program progresses.
- Problem-solving as a developer must be done strategically to be effective. This is where the importance of pseudo-coding comes into play, as it will be nearly impossible to come up with the proper syntax, if the problem can't be broken into discrete chunks and described in plain English first.

- I will review notes and material before and after each session, to make the material more concrete. In past academic settings, my habit was to study in discrete blocks, completely independent of the class schedule, usually in preparation of tests. The article on fluency explained the importance of routine practice/repetition to build fluency, and therefore understanding, which will require a new study approach on my end that I haven't tried as much before.
- I will try to manage my time even more effectively than I have in the past, by scheduling breaks and time for self-care, to ensure that I will remain as productive as possible during time scheduled to work on projects. Additionally, I will time myself to ensure I'm not stuck for too long of a period of time, before engaging my peers and instructors for support, of course, following best practices for asking technical questions.
